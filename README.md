## About App

This app displays election data. It is built with React, with Semantic-UI used for design.

## Key Attributes
* Responsive
* Class components are used for components with state and stateless functional components are used for components without state (presentational components).
* The CSS in JS approach is used for most of the basic styling. For a larger application, all styling would be in a css file linked to a specific component or an official CSS-in-JS library
